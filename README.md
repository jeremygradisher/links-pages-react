# React app - Links and Pages

A React application can contain dozens, or even hundreds, of components.

Each component might be small and relatively unremarkable on its own. When combined, however, they can form enormous, fantastically complex ecosystems of information.

In other words, React apps are made out of components, but what makes React special isn’t components themselves. What makes React special is the ways in which components interact.

Here is a .render() method that returns an HTML-like JSX element:
```
class Example extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
}
```
You’ve seen render methods return <div></div>s, <p></p>s, and <h1></h1>s, just like in the above example.

Render methods can also return another kind of JSX: component instances.
```
class OMG extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Whooaa!</h1>;
  }
}
 
class Crazy extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <OMG />;
  }
}
```
In the above example, Crazy‘s render method returns an instance of the OMG component class. You could say that Crazy renders an <OMG />.


Apply a Component in a Render Function
This is new territory! You’ve never seen a component rendered by another component before.

You have seen a component rendered before, though, but not by another component. Instead, you’ve seen a component rendered by ReactDOM.render().

When a component renders another component, what happens is very similar to what happens when ReactDOM.render() renders a component.

We’ve used import before, but not like this! Notice the differences between the above line of code and this familiar line:

import React from 'react';
The first important difference is the curly braces around NavBar. We’ll get to those soon!

The second important difference involves the contents of the string at the end of the statement: 'react' vs './NavBar.js'.

If you use an import statement, and the string at the end begins with either a dot or a slash, then import will treat that string as a filepath. import will follow that filepath, and import the file that it finds.

If your filepath doesn’t have a file extension, then “.js” is assumed. So the above example could be shortened:
```
import { NavBar } from './NavBar';
````

When you import a variable from a file that is not the current file, then an import statement isn’t quite enough. You also need an export statement, written in the other file, exporting the variable that you hope to grab.

export comes from ES6’s module system, just like import does. export and import are meant to be used together, and you rarely see one without the other.

“named exports.” Here’s how named exports works:

In one file, place the keyword export immediately before something that you want to export. That something can be any top-level var, let, const, function, or class:
```
// Manifestos.js:
 
export const faveManifestos = {
  futurist: 'http://www.artype.de/Sammlung/pdf/russolo_noise.pdf',
  agile: 'https://agilemanifesto.org/iso/en/manifesto.html',
  cyborg:   'http://faculty.georgetown.edu/irvinem/theory/Haraway-CyborgManifesto-1.pdf'
};
```
You can export multiple things from the same file:
```
// Manifestos.js:
 
export const faveManifestos = {
  futurist: 'http://www.artype.de/Sammlung/pdf/russolo_noise.pdf',
  agile:  'https://agilemanifesto.org/iso/en/manifesto.html',
  cyborg:   'http://faculty.georgetown.edu/irvinem/theory/Haraway-CyborgManifesto-1.pdf'
};
 
export const alsoRan = 'TimeCube';
```
In a different file, import the name of the var, let, const, function, or class from the first file:
```
// App.js:
 
// Import faveManifestos and alsoRan from ./Manifestos.js:
import { faveManifestos, alsoRan } from './Manifestos';
 
// Use faveManifestos:
console.log(`A Cyborg Manifesto:  ${faveManifestos.cyborg}`); 
This style of importing and exporting in JavaScript is known as “named exports.” When you use named exports, you always need to wrap your imported names in curly braces, such as:

import { faveManifestos, alsoRan } from './Manifestos';`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
